# Assisted Driving
This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis and focuses on designing and evaluating a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for partially automated driving.
The primary goal of this HMI is to effectively communicate the functionalities and limitations of partial automated driving systems to users.

## Dependencies
### Node.js
This HMI requires a Node.js server to work with the database. To start the server, ensure Node.js is installed on your system.

To check, if it's already downloaded, run:
```shell
node -v
npm -v
```
If both commands return version numbers, Node.js and npm are installed.


If it's not downloaded, go to https://nodejs.org/en#download, download the installer, and follow the installation prompts.

To download all the other dependencies, run this after successfully downloading Node.js.
```shell
npm install
```

## Run
```shell
npm run start
```
This will start a Server running at http://localhost:3000

## Database Structure
All tables in the database are connected through a unique identification_code, which is randomly generated for each user.
This code links data across multiple tables, ensuring that all user-related information remains consistent and easily accessible.
If there are any uncertainties regarding how the data is organized, I recommend clicking through the project to observe 
how the entries update and interact. The database generates automatically.

## Project Structure
This project consists of five main pages: Overview, Profile, Tutorial, Welcome, and LiveSimulation. 
Each page has its own HTML file, while some content is dynamically created using JavaScript.
JavaScript is also utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.
Every page is associated with one or more JavaScript files for specific functionality.

```
In category questions the categories for the WHOLE HMI gets defined - if you want to add/remove categories, you have to do it there.
There each category also gets it's icon assigned
